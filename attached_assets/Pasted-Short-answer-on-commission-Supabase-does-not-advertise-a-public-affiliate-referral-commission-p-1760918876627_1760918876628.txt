Short answer on commission: **Supabase does not advertise a public affiliate / referral commission program.** They have a **Partner/Marketplace** program (integration & co-marketing) and an **advocate (SupaSquad)** community track, but there’s no public “get paid per customer you refer” scheme documented. If you want revenue share, it typically means **direct BD with Supabase** or offering your own affiliate for Supernova and integrating with their OAuth/Marketplace for distribution. ([Supabase][1])

That said, we can still monetize referrals **on our side** (e.g., Rewardful/PartnerStack/Tapfiliate) and track which projects connected to Supabase via Supernova, then do co-marketing with Supabase. If you want, I’ll wire a neutral **referral-tracking module** into the builder.

`sha256: ccfdce298da7d6137c0581cef9025f9f02c5cfca5c14362f8be33ee969e03d`

What’s inside:

* New files:

  * `client/src/lib/supabase.js`
  * `client/src/pages/SupabaseCheck.jsx`
  * `client/src/pages/SupabaseSettings.jsx`
  * `server/src/integrations/supabase.js`
  * `server/src/routes/db.health.js`
  * `sql/supabase_bootstrap.sql`
* Diffs you can apply with `git apply patches/*.patch`:

  * Add DB health route to `server/index.js`
  * Extend dev FS allowlist to include `client` (so the wizard can write `.env`)
  * Add settings routes in `client/src/main.jsx`
  * Add `@supabase/supabase-js` to both package.json files
* `README.md` with exact steps

## Install (super quick)

```bash
# 1) unzip over your repo root
# 2) deps
cd server && npm i @supabase/supabase-js
cd ../client && npm i @supabase/supabase-js

# 3) run
cd ../server && npm run dev
cd ../client && npm run dev
```

Then:

* Go to `http://localhost:5173/settings/supabase/setup`
* Paste `Project URL`, `Anon key`, `Service Role key` → **Save** → **Server DB Health**
* Optional: in Supabase, run `sql/supabase_bootstrap.sql`, then visit `/settings/supabase` and click **Test client query**

## Production wiring (Helm)

Add to your env/secrets:

```yaml
env:
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL: "https://xxxx.supabase.co"
# inject VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY at client build time

secrets:
  SUPABASE_URL: "https://xxxx.supabase.co"
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE: "<service-role-key>"
```

## If you want referral revenue anyway

Two paths:

1. **Run your own affiliate for Supernova** (reward users who connect Supabase via our connector). We can integrate **Rewardful** or **Tapfiliate** quickly and store events in Supabase for analytics. ([go.outseta.com][2])
2. **Co-sell with Supabase** via their **Partners/Marketplace** listing; negotiate MDF or co-marketing benefits. Not the same as commissions, but it grows pipeline. ([Supabase][1])

Say **“add referrals”** and I’ll ship a minimal module: link generator, cookie attribution, payout export CSV, and webhooks for your payment processor.
