Locked. I consolidated everything into a single, larger, ready-to-run pack so you don’t have to copy/paste across many files.

**Download:** [supernova-builder-all-in-one-20251019-221938.zip](sandbox:/mnt/data/supernova-builder-all-in-one-20251019-221938.zip)

# What’s inside (one repo)

```
supernova-builder/
  server/                 # Express API: /dev fs, diffs, tokens, terminal (whitelist), SSE, /healthz
  client/                 # Vite + React + Monaco: /dev console, /diff viewer, design mode, live preview
  mobile-expo/            # Expo skeleton (kept minimal; you’ll expand in Sprints)
  deploy/helm/...         # Minimal Helm chart (+ Helmfile envs) for quick k8s deploys
  helmfile/...            # dev/staging/prod environments
  README.md               # quick start + security defaults
```

# How to run (bug-free path)

1. Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3001
```

2. Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173  (proxies /api to :3001)
```

3. Optional: single-process preview build

```bash
cd client && npm run build
# copy dist into server/public (or adjust server to serve from /public)
```

# What you get (Sprint 2/3 core)

* **Dev Console (/dev):** file tree (allowlist), Monaco editor, save with unified diffs, live preview via SSE, terminal (strict whitelist).
* **Diffs (/diff):** timestamped unified diffs (persisted to `server/.supernova/diffs.json`).
* **Design tokens:** GET/POST `/api/design/tokens` → apply as CSS vars in client; instant theme updates.
* **Security rails:** dev-open auth by default; path normalization; rate limits; command whitelist; production mode disables dev FS & terminal routes.
* **Health:** `/healthz` ready for probes.

# Why this is “bigger files, fewer steps”

* One ZIP, one repo layout.
* Client and server already wired (Vite dev proxy to server).
* Tokens, diffs, SSE, and terminal are pre-integrated.
* Minimal Helm + Helmfile included to deploy as a single service when you’re ready.

# Production notes (to go live safely)

* Set real secrets (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `AUTH_*`, `COLLAB_PAY_*`, Sentry DSN) before deploying.
* Flip `DEV_AUTH_OPEN=false` for prod.
* Consider swapping JWT verifier to JWKS (we kept HS256 dev verifier to reduce dependencies).
* Terminal & dev FS endpoints are already disabled in `NODE_ENV=production`.

If you want me to also include the **full collab Helm library** + migrate/seed hooks inside this single repo (so infra + app ship together), say **“merge infra into kit”** and I’ll append the previously shipped Helm library and hooks into this ZIP structure.
